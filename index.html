                        Painted Horizons LLC is a locally owned company focused on quality, reliability,
                        and clear expectations. From the first walkthrough to the final touch-up, we treat your home

                    <p>
                        We started with professional interior and exterior painting, and are growing into a

                        umbrella, we offer painting, deck and fence staining, small prep repairs, basic digital
                        visibility services, Amazon Hub–related support, and a box recycling option for the community.

                        Painted Horizons LLC is built to make life easier for people who need more than one kind
                        of help. Maybe you need your exterior painted this season, but you’re also thinking about
                        improving your online presence, or finding a reliable local contact for Amazon Hub–related work.

                    <p>
                        Instead of juggling multiple vendors, you can work with one local, owner-operated business
                        that understands Door County and Northeast Wisconsin.
